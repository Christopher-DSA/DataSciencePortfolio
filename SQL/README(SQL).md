# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project is an analysis of the ecommerce dataset that comes from an online store and the documentation of that process from start to finish.

My goal with this final project is to put all my SQL skills to the test and continue to learn more during the project.

## Process
### (Step 1)
First I loaded all the csv files into a newdata base called ecommerce using pgadmin4.
### (Step 2)
Then I reviewed the data in the tables to see what kind of information was within each column. I also spent time looking for any dirty data.
### (Step 3)
Next, I started working on creating queries to clean the data. Once I was done I created a new clean version of each table, keeping the old ones as backup temporaily.
### (Step 4)
Next, I started answering the 5 questions in part 3 using SQL queries.
### (Step 5)
Finally I did QA on my data and identified risk areas by running queries to validate the accuracy of my results in parts 3 and 4.

## Results
I discovered this data could tell me a lot about the demographic, revenue and products customers were purchasing on the website the data came from.
I learned that the website had 14,223 unique visitors, most of which came from the United States.
The most revenue was generated by visitors From the United States.

## Challenges 
Learning to understand the buisness process of the website through the data and never being able to walk through how the website works or the context each piece of data was collected for myself was challenging at first, but as I explored the data more I was able to get the bigger picture of how the data was put together.

Data type divison was an unexpected challenge in this project. I created a query to calculate the percentage of customers who visited website and also made a purchase but I would always get the result of 0. The issues was that the data I was dividing was the big int data type. After casting to the numeric type I got the expected result.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would search for tools to automate parts of the cleaning process, learning new technologies is never a bad thing.

I would have tried to make some sort of flow chart outlining how the business process works and how and when each piece data gets added to the database.
